# General {.body}

## Scope {.body}

This document specifies the process used to produce open-source projects within
the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

The process follows general practices within the larger open-source community;
however, this document:

- provides a step-by-step overview of the process, so that those unfamiliar with
  open-source processes can better understand the process and become
  contributors,
- formalizes the process (e.g., by clearly defining what are requirements), and
- tailors the process (e.g., by defining the preferred tools to be used).

The process to approve the resultant product is defined elsewhere (e.g., NTCIP 8001).

The ITS Open-Source Process is based on the practices defined by
[open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/tree/main). However, whereas
open-sauced is written as an informative guide and describes how systems can
work; this document is written as a specification to define how the ITS
Open-Source Process will work. While still providing a discussion of the issues;
it highlights the requirements and notable options along the way by stating each
in its own paragraph, starting the paragraph with the requirement (REQ) or
option (OPT) number. Conditional requirements are listed as requirements, but
include a condition in the text (e.g., If X, then ...). The remaining text
provides further guidance and can include additional options that do not
necessitate specific numbering.

We recognize that onboarding to a new project can be challenging, especially if
you're new to open source development. Be patient, and don't be discouraged by
setbacks or mistakes. You'll become more comfortable and confident in your
contributions with persistence and practice.

## General Statements {.body}

The remainder of this document is broken into the following chapters:

- **Commenting Process:** Details the process of contributing to open-source
  projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
  the ITS open-source projects.
- **Contribution Process:** Details the process of contributing to open-source
  projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
  the ITS open-source projects.
- **Maintenance Process:** Details the rules that project maintainers are to
  follow when managing an ITS open-source project. This includes processes for
  setting up new projects, managing issues and pull requests, maintaining
  quality, and coordinating with standard development organizations.
- **Approval Process:** Defines the approval stages for ITS open-source projects
  and the processes required for approval for each stage and subsequent tagging
  and publication of versions.[^move to 8001]
- **Documentation Conventions:** Annex B defines the preferred styles,
  processes, and tools for developing documentation for ITS open-source
  projects, including projects that are 100% documentation (e.g., the ITS
  Open-Source Process project).
- **Code Conventions:** Annex C defines the styles, processes, and tools for
  developing computer code for ITS open-source projects, including Python and
  ASN.1.
- **Requirements Management:** Defines preferred ways to use requirement
  management tools to produce content that can be easily integrated into the ITS
  open-source pojects while providing clear traceability.
